                    As a family, we manage 9,000 acres of privately owned property dedicated to recreational hunts. We also reside and operate a year-round campground situated in the heart of this expansive land. The property's access is exclusively restricted to our clients, ensuring that the wildlife can thrive and reach its full potential. We diligently observe and monitor the wildlife using trail cameras and engage in extensive footwork throughout the year. Scouting is our favorite pastime, as we closely monitor trails leading to food sources, while continuously adding and maintaining Food Plots to sustain the local wildlife.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As stewards of this vast 9,000-acre property, our family takes great pride in ensuring its optimal management for recreational hunts. The property's exclusivity, with restricted access limited only to our clients, creates a sanctuary where wildlife can flourish undisturbed. By maintaining such control over access, we are able to preserve the natural balance and foster an environment where animals can thrive and reach their full potential.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Throughout the year, our commitment to wildlife conservation is evident in the meticulous care we dedicate to monitoring and observing the resident fauna. We employ a combination of modern technology and good old-fashioned footwork to keep a watchful eye on the creatures that call this property home. Trail cameras strategically placed throughout the land provide invaluable insights into the habits and behaviors of various species, allowing us to track their movements and gain a deeper understanding of their needs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, it is not solely through technological means that we ensure the well-being of the wildlife. Our family enthusiastically engages in the art of scouting, which has become a beloved pastime for us. We eagerly explore the terrain, meticulously surveying the trails that lead to vital food sources. By closely monitoring these pathways, we can anticipate the animals' movements and establish a deeper connection with the land. Additionally, we continuously enhance the habitat by adding and tending to Food Plots. These purposefully cultivated areas provide a sustainable food source for the wildlife, supporting their overall health and contributing to the thriving ecosystem that exists within the property.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our year-round campground located at the heart of this magnificent landscape, we not only witness the wonders of nature firsthand but also serve as advocates for its conservation. We believe that by responsibly managing this property, we play a vital role in preserving and protecting the local wildlife, ensuring that future generations can continue to experience the beauty and bounty it offers.

                <p>
                    Hunts take place from Sunday to Sunday, as there is no hunting on Sundays in Maine. Please plan your arrival for 1:00 pm or later on the Sunday before your hunt. Departure should be by 11:00 am or earlier on the Sunday following your hunt.
