                    Sites are meticulously baited and equipped with trail cameras, which are checked daily throughout the hunting season. These practices remain consistent regardless of whether the sites are actively hunted. It's worth mentioning that these bait sites are situated on our extensive 9,000-acre private property. We take great care to ensure the privacy and exclusivity of our hunting experience, as the roads leading to the sites are gated and inaccessible to general traffic. Only authorized individuals, such as our valued hunters, are granted access. Rest assured, your hunt will proceed undisturbed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To preserve the ecological balance and enhance the quality of the hunt, we limit the number of hunters to a maximum of five per week. By avoiding excessive hunting pressure, we maintain the integrity of the area and create a more personalized hunting experience for our guests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At each site, we provide trail cameras to monitor the bear activity closely. This enables us to assess both the quantity and quality of the bears present. Over the years, we have observed and documented world-class bears in our hunting grounds. In fact, many of these remarkable creatures have been given individual names. This level of familiarity with the local bear population allows us to strategically position you in the ideal location for encountering the bear that matches your preferences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Come and experience an unforgettable Northern Maine Black Bear Hunt with us.

                <p>
                    Guided moose hunts are available on private property in Zones 4 and 9. The hunts take place on gated and managed land, ensuring exclusivity within a vast area of either 2,700 or 3,000 acres. This land is strictly off-limits to the public and carefully maintained to preserve wildlife. Trail cameras are utilized to monitor the moose population on the property.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every year, food plots are cultivated and new ones are added, contributing to the well-being and potential of the moose. The combination of these nourishing food plots and limited hunting access has facilitated the moose in reaching their full growth potential. To enhance your hunting experience, there are elevated hunting shacks strategically positioned on the food plots. These shacks provide warmth and comfort, allowing you to observe from an advantageous vantage point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Included in the package is a cabin rental situated on the shoreline of Ripogenus Lake for the entire week, available to the lottery winner and their sub-permitee. The cabin boasts modern amenities such as running water, a shower, and a toilet. Additional guests can join for a fee of $1,000 per person per week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During your hunting expeditions in the morning, your lunch will be prepared for you to take along. Breakfast will be your responsibility and can be enjoyed in your cabin. Upon returning from a day of hunting, a hearty supper will be awaiting your arrival. The cabin is equipped with cookware, utensils, and other essentials. You'll also have access to a cooktop stove, fridge, and freezer for your convenience.

                    Trophy? Mature 8 points or better! This is a significant aspect of our Whitetail Management Program. Trail cameras are used year-round to monitor herd health, population, and antler growth. Through these pictures, we can identify the deer present in the hunting area. Another component of our program is the creation of wildlife food plots, starting with clover in the spring and transitioning to turnips in the fall. We provide our deer with top-of-the-line vegetation and minerals, and due to the limited hunting, we allow these deer to reach full maturity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The North Woods of Maine is renowned for its large deer, both in terms of body size and antler size. However, locating these mature deer in the vast forest of the North Woods can be challenging. Without proper scouting, hunting these impressive creatures becomes a difficult task. Our year-round scouting trails, trail cameras, and the habitat we provide take care of the groundwork even before you decide to embark on your hunt. This enables us to not only determine when, but also who is using those trails, ridges, or food plots! All stands and ground blinds are already positioned in high-traffic areas for deer. We offer a wide range of hunting locations, from close-range bow stands to long-distance shots. Whether it's a ground blind or an elevated hunting shack, we will find the option that suits you best.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After breakfast, you will pack your gear and food (as you won't return until after dark). You will then accompany your guide to the hunting area. Your guide will take you to your designated stand, where you are to remain until he returns to retrieve you. The stand may be a ladder stand or a ground blind/hut. If you need to leave the stand, a marked trail will lead you to the road. Please stay on the designated trail to and from your stand. When you take a shot, your guide will be nearby and will come to assist you shortly. Remain at your stand location and try to remember the location of the animal when it was shot. Your guide will help track down and retrieve your deer. He will field dress and hang it at camp until you are ready to take it to the tagging station. We can provide advice on local taxidermy and butchering services, which are not included in our hunts.

                <p>
                    The northern regions of Maine boast a thriving grouse population—just ask anyone around! With 9,000 acres of private property abundant in high-quality food sources, we have created the finest grouse habitat in Northern Maine. At Black Hat Hunting, we dedicate significant time to improving the bird's habitat, attracting a multitude of birds to our property and ensuring exceptional grouse hunting experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At our establishment, we don't rely on pointers (although we do have a retriever). Instead, we traverse clover roads, hardwood ridge trails, and ride within the confines of our 9,000 acres of privately owned, gated, and carefully managed land. The presence of gates guarantees uninterrupted opportunities, limited pressure, and consequently, calmer birds—resulting in a greater abundance of them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The managed land entails strategically placed food plots and well-maintained trails leading to remote off-road areas. The northern woods of Maine already harbor numerous birds, but thanks to Black Hat Hunting's efforts, including the introduction of clover plots and late-season winter green plots, we have further enhanced the already exceptional grouse hunting on our property.
                </p>
                <p>Prices:</p>
